# Trulia_webscraper
An _extremely_ crude wrapper for a trulia.com webscraper that collects residential home listings and downloads them to the active directory.

**Currently**- documentation is absent, but `trulia.webscraper::trulia(state, city, k)` is pretty self-explanatory. 
Where `k` is the number of pages from Trulia for the function to iterate over.
